    <h1>About Garner Engineering</h1>
    <p>
        I’m John Garner. I started Garner Engineering to help dam owners enjoy the water and stop worrying about their dams.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you need assistance fixing a dam, decommissioning a pond or lake, or responding to a letter from your state’s dam safety office, I can help.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Expect: The Dam Design Process</h2>

    <p>At Garner Engineering, the dam design process generally includes 4 phases:</p>

    <h3>1. Preliminary Design & Construction Cost Estimate</h3>
    <p>
    First, I’ll visit your dam in order to inspect it. If you’ve received a letter from your state’s dam safety office, I’ll review that letter with you to explain what it means and how we can fix it. We’ll go over any design requirements for the project, and I’ll prepare a preliminary design for your review, including my best estimate for construction cost.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Final Design & Permitting</h3>
    <p>
        Next, I’ll conduct a series of flood routing and flow analyses to inform the design specifications of the
        dam. I’ll then draft the final plans for the dam using AutoCAD. Upon completion, I’ll submit them to the
        State Dam Safety Office for review. We’ll also take care of local construction and environmental permits
        at this point.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Construction Bidding</h3>
    <p>
        After the Dam Safety Office reviews the plans, we’ll send out a request for proposals from several
        construction companies to get you the best price on construction costs. Over the past 19 years of
        fixing dams, I’ve developed relationships with several contractors that I trust to do high-quality
        work. I’m happy to recommend them to you at this point.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Construction Observation & As-Built Plan Submission</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, I’ll observe the construction to make sure it meets design standards. As needed, we’ll
        contract third-party materials testing companies to perform testing on concrete, compacted sand/dirt,
        and other materials used in construction. Once construction is completed, I’ll submit as-built plans
        to the State Dam Safety Office.
    </p>

    <h2>Other Services</h2>
    <p>In addition to dams, I have experience designing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Retaining walls</li>
        <li>Culverts and channels</li>
        <li>Parking lot rainwater runoff and drainage</li>
        <li>Stormwater detention facilities</li>
        <li>Stormwater pollution prevention plans (SWPPPs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>I’d love to hear more about your dam or civil engineering needs.</p>

    <p>
        Please, send me an email, and tell me a little bit about your dam/project. If the project makes sense
        for my expertise, we’ll set up a time to chat on the phone or in-person.
    </p>
