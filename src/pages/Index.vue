    <h2>Expertise: How We Help Dam Owners Like You</h2>

    <h3>Dam Inspections</h3>
    <p>
        Maybe you’ve owned a lake or pond for years. Or perhaps you’re thinking of purchasing a pond. We bring
        20+ years of dam engineering expertise to every inspection to help dam owners rest easy.
    </p>

    <h3>Remediation Design</h3>
    <p>
        As your dam ages, it will need repairs to avoid failure. I design comprehensive plans that meet
        states’ rigorous dam safety regulations and safely extend your dam’s lifespan.
    </p>

    <h3>Operations & Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
        Dams require ongoing care to operate safely. I develop maintenance plans for dams that take the worry
        out of dam ownership, and I have relationships with expert contractors to get the job done.

        My emergency action plans detail steps to be taken should anything go wrong with your dam. This
        document is for your personal use as the dam owner and also on file with the proper officials to bring
        you peace of mind.
